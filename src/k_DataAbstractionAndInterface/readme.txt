INTERFACE

- An Interface is a blueprint of class
- Interface contains only final and static variables
- Interface contains abstratc methods (also allowed default and static methods from java 8 onwards)
- An abstract method has only signature (method name, return type, paramters) but no body (Un-implemented method)
- Methods in interface are public
- Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance
- We can define interface with interface keyword
- A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface
- We can create Object reference for interface but we cannot instantiate interface
