 - Polymorphism can be achieved by OVERLOADING 
 - METHOD OVERLOADING - Having multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but with different parameter lists.
 - This is applicable for methods and constructors
 
    
    Primary Use of Method Overloading
	- To improve code readability and usability by performing the same operation with different inputs.
 
 - Rules for overloading a method
 	 - Method name should be the same
 	 - Number of parameters should be different
 	 - Data Type of parameters should be different
 	 - Order of parameters should be different
 	 
 	 - Method signature = method name + parameters
 	 - Return type is NOT considered
 	 
 - MAIN METHOD can be overloaded and the same rules as above applies when overloading the main method
 	 
 	 
  - ENCAPSULATION
  - Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods together into a single unit and controlling access to the data using access modifiers.
  - In Java, this is achieved using:
		- private variables
		- public getter and setter methods
		- variables can be accessed/operated only through methods (getters and setters)
		
  - Why Encapsulation is Needed
		- Protects data from unauthorized access
		- Prevents accidental modification
		- Improves maintainability
		- Enables data validation
