 - Polymorphism can be achieved by OVERLOADING 
 - METHOD OVERLOADING - Having multiple methods with the same name in the same class, but with different parameter lists.
 - This is applicable for methods and constructors
 
 - Rules for overloading a method
 	 - Method name should be the same
 	 - Number of parameters should be different
 	 - Data Type of parameters should be different
 	 - Order of parameters should be different
 	 
 	 - Method signature = method name + parameters
 	 - Return type is NOT considered
