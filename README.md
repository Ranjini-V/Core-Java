# Core Java Fundamentals

This repository demonstartes my hands-on understanding of Core Java concepts through clean, practicle examples and small programs.
The codebase is actively evolving as I implement new concepts.

# Topics (In Progress)

Basics
-  Variables & Data Types
-  Operators & Expressions
-  Conditional Statements
-  Loops (for, while, do-while)

Arrays
-  Single & Multi-Dimensional Arrays
-  Sorting & searching
-  Common array problems (largest, missing number, primes)

Strings
-  String immutability
-  String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
-  Removing special characters & whitespace
-  Word count logic (with & without built-in methods)

OOPS (Upcoming / In Progress)
-  Classes & Objects
-  Methods & Constructors
-  Inheritance
-  Polymorphism
-  Encapsulation
-  Abstraction & Interfaces

Advanced Topics (Planned)
-  Exception Handling
-  Type Casting
